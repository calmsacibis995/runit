The runit init daemon.

# What is this repository?
This a repository that contains the source code for runit init daemon, but maintained, and updated for modern systems.

# Are you going to become the official maintainer for runit?
No, I just want to create an updated version of runit, that eliminates all warnings that are created when compiling on modern systems.
